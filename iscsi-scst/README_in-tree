iSCSI SCST target driver
========================

ISCSI-SCST is a deeply reworked fork of iSCSI Enterprise Target (IET)
(http://iscsitarget.sourceforge.net). Reasons of the fork were:

 - To be able to use full power of SCST core.

 - To fix all the problems, corner cases issues and iSCSI standard
   violations which IET has.

See more info at http://scst.sourceforge.net/target_iscsi.html.

Usage
-----

See in http://scst.sourceforge.net/iscsi-scst-howto.txt how to configure
iSCSI-SCST.

In 2.0.0 usage of iscsi-scstd.conf as well as iscsi-scst-adm utility is
obsolete. Use the sysfs interface facilities instead.

It is recommended to use TEST UNIT READY ("tur") command to check if
iSCSI-SCST target is alive in MPIO configurations.

IMPORTANT: In the procfs build all LUN information (access control)
=========  MUST be configured BEFORE iscsi-scstd started!

Also see SCST README file how to tune for the best performance.

CAUTION: Working of target and initiator on the same host isn't fully
=======  supported. See SCST README file for details.


Sysfs interface
---------------

Starting from 2.0.0 iSCSI-SCST has sysfs interface. You can switch to it
by running "make disable_proc". To switch back to the procfs interface
you should run "make enable_proc". The procfs interface from version
2.0.0 is obsolete and will be removed in one of the next versions.

Root of SCST sysfs interface is /sys/kernel/scst_tgt. Root of iSCSI-SCST
is /sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi. It has the following entries:

 - None, one or more subdirectories for targets with name equal to names
   of the corresponding targets.

 - IncomingUser[num] - optional one or more attributes containing user
   name and password for incoming discovery user name. Not exist by
   default and can be added through "mgmt" entry, see below.

 - OutgoingUser - optional attribute containing user name and password
   for outgoing discovery user name. Not exist by default and can be
   added through "mgmt" entry, see below.

 - iSNSServer - contains name or IP address of iSNS server with optional
   "AccessControl" attribute, which allows to enable iSNS access
   control. Empty by default.

 - enabled - using this attribute you can enable or disable iSCSI-SCST
   accept new connections. It allows to finish configuring global
   iSCSI-SCST attributes before it starts accepting new connections. 0
   by default.

 - open_state - read-only attribute, which allows to see if the user
   space part of iSCSI-SCST connected to the kernel part.

 - trace_level - allows to enable and disable various tracing
   facilities. See content of this file for help how to use it.

 - version - read-only attribute, which allows to see version of
   iSCSI-SCST and enabled optional features.

 - mgmt - main management entry, which allows to configure iSCSI-SCST.
   Namely, add/delete targets as well as add/delete optional global and
   per-target attributes. See content of this file for help how to use
   it.

Each iSCSI-SCST sysfs file (attribute) can contain in the last line mark
"[key]". It is automatically added mark used to allow scstadmin to see
which attributes it should save in the config file. You can ignore it.

Each target subdirectory contains the following entries:

 - ini_groups - subdirectory defining initiator groups for this target,
   used to define per-initiator access control. See SCST core README for
   more details.

 - luns - subdirectory defining LUNs of this target. See SCST core
   README for more details.

 - sessions - subdirectory containing connected to this target sessions.

 - IncomingUser[num] - optional one or more attributes containing user
   name and password for incoming user name. Not exist by default and can
   be added through the "mgmt" entry, see above.

 - OutgoingUser - optional attribute containing user name and password
   for outgoing user name. Not exist by default and can be added through
   the "mgmt" entry, see above.

 - Entries defining default iSCSI parameters values used during iSCSI
   parameters negotiation. Only entries which can be changed or make
   sense are listed there.

 - QueuedCommands - defines maximum number of commands queued to any
   session of this target. Default is 32 commands.

 - RspTimeout - defines the maximum time in seconds a command can wait for
   response from initiator, otherwise the corresponding connection will
   be closed. For performance reasons it is implemented as a timer,
   which once in RspTimeout time checks the oldest command waiting for
   response and, if it's older than RspTimeout, then it closes the
   connection. Hence, a stalled connection will be closed in time
   between RspTimeout and 2*RspTimeout. Default is 30 seconds.

 - NopInInterval - defines interval between NOP-In requests, which the
   target will send on idle connections to check if the initiator is
   still alive. If there is no NOP-Out reply from the initiator in
   RspTimeout time, the corresponding connection will be closed. Default
   is 30 seconds. If it's set to 0, then NOP-In requests are disabled.

 - enabled - using this attribute you can enable or disable iSCSI-SCST
   accept new connections to this target. It allows to finish
   configuring it before it starts accepting new connections. 0 by
   default.

 - rel_tgt_id - allows to read or write SCSI Relative Target Port
   Identifier attribute. This identifier is used to identify SCSI Target
   Ports by some SCSI commands, mainly by Persistent Reservations
   commands. This identifier must be unique among all SCST targets, but
   for convenience SCST allows disabled targets to have not unique
   rel_tgt_id. In this case SCST will not allow to enable this target
   until rel_tgt_id becomes unique. This attribute initialized unique by
   SCST by default.

 - tid - TID of this target.

Subdirectory "sessions" contains one subdirectory for each connected
session with name equal to name of the connected initiator.

Each session subdirectory contains the following entries:

 - One subdirectory for each TCP connection in this session. ISCSI-SCST
   supports 1 connection per session, but the session subdirectory can
   contain several connections: one active and other being closed.

 - Entries defining negotiated iSCSI parameters. Only parameters which
   can be changed or make sense are listed there.

 - initiator_name - contains initiator name

 - sid - contains SID of this session

 - reinstating - contains reinstatement state of this session

 - force_close - write-only attribute, which allows to force close this
   session. This is the only writable session attribute.

 - active_commands - contains number of active, i.e. not yet or being
   executed, SCSI commands in this session.

 - commands - contains overall number of SCSI commands in this session.

Each connection subdirectory contains the following entries:

 - cid - contains CID of this connection.

 - ip - contains IP address of the connected initiator.

 - state - contains processing state of this connection.

Below is a sample script, which configures 1 virtual disk "disk1" using
/disk1 image and one target iqn.2006-10.net.vlnb:tgt with all default
parameters:

#!/bin/bash

modprobe scst
modprobe scst_vdisk

echo "add_device disk1 filename=/disk1; nv_cache=1" >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/handlers/vdisk_fileio/mgmt

service iscsi-scst start

echo "add_target iqn.2006-10.net.vlnb:tgt" >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/mgmt
echo "add disk1 0" >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/iqn.2006-10.net.vlnb:tgt/luns/mgmt

echo 1 >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/iqn.2006-10.net.vlnb:tgt/enabled
echo 1 >/sys/kernel/scst_tgt/targets/iscsi/enabled

Below is more advanced sample script, which configures more virtual
devices of various types, including virtual CDROM and 2 targets, one
with all default parameters, another one with some not default
parameters, incoming and outgoing user names for CHAP authentification,
and special permissions for initiator iqn.2005-03.org.open-iscsi:cacdcd2520,
which will see another set of devices. Also this sample configures CHAP
authentication for discovery sessions and iSNS server with access control.

The resulting overall SCST sysfs hierarchy with an initiator connected to
both iSCSI-SCST targets will look like:

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you have any problems, start troubleshooting from looking at the
kernel and system logs. In the kernel log iSCSI-SCST and SCST core send
their messages, in the system log iscsi-scstd sends its messages. In
most Linux distributions both those logs are put to /var/log/messages
file.

Then, it might be helpful to increase level of logging. For kernel
modules you should make the debug build by enabling CONFIG_SCST_DEBUG.

If after looking on the logs the reason of your problem is still unclear
for you, report to SCST mailing list scst-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.


Work if target's backstorage or link is too slow
------------------------------------------------

In some cases you can experience I/O stalls or see in the kernel log
abort or reset messages. It can happen under high I/O load, when your
target's backstorage gets overloaded, or working over a slow link, when
the link can't serve all the queued commands on time,

To workaround it you can reduce QueuedCommands parameter for the
corresponding target to some lower value, like 8 (default is 32).

Also see SCST README file for more details about that issue and ways to
prevent it.


Performance advices
-------------------

1. If you use Windows XP or Windows 2003+ as initiators, you should
consider to decrease TcpAckFrequency parameter to 1. See
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/328890/ or google for "TcpAckFrequency"
for more details.

2. See how to get the maximum throughput from iSCSI, for instance, at
http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2009/01/a-multivendor-post-to-help-our-mutual-iscsi-customers-using-vmware.html.
It's about VMware, but its recommendations apply to other environments
as well.

3. ISCSI initiators built in pre-CentOS/RHEL 5 reported to have some
performance problems. If you use it, it is strongly advised to upgrade.


Compilation options
-------------------

There are the following compilation options, that could be commented
in/out in the kernel's module Makefile:

 - CONFIG_SCST_DEBUG - turns on some debugging code, including some logging.
   Makes the driver considerably bigger and slower, producing large amount of
   log data.

 - CONFIG_SCST_TRACING - turns on ability to log events. Makes the driver
   considerably bigger and leads to some performance loss.

 - CONFIG_SCST_EXTRACHECKS - adds extra validity checks in the various places.

 - CONFIG_SCST_ISCSI_DEBUG_DIGEST_FAILURES - simulates digest failures in
   random places.
