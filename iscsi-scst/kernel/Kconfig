	  ISCSI target driver for SCST framework. The iSCSI protocol has been
	  defined in RFC 3720. To use it you should download from
	  http://scst.sourceforge.net the user space part of it.

config SCST_ISCSI_DEBUG_DIGEST_FAILURES
	bool "Simulate iSCSI digest failures"
	depends on SCST_ISCSI
	help
	  Simulates iSCSI digest failures in random places. Even when iSCSI
	  traffic is sent over a TCP connection, the 16-bit TCP checksum is too
	  weak for the requirements of a storage protocol. Furthermore, there
	  are also instances where the TCP checksum does not protect iSCSI
	  data, as when data is corrupted while being transferred on a PCI bus
	  or while in memory. The iSCSI protocol therefore defines a 32-bit CRC
	  digest on iSCSI packets in order to detect data corruption on an
	  end-to-end basis. CRCs can be used on iSCSI PDU headers and/or data.
	  Enabling this option allows to test digest failure recovery in the
	  iSCSI initiator that is talking to SCST.

	  If unsure, say "N".

config CONFIG_SCST_ISCSI_SKIP_ISID
	bool "Do not use ISID in initiator port transport id"
	depends on SCST_ISCSI
	help
	  Makes iSCSI-SCST to always use iSCSI initiator port
	  TransportID format 0, i.e. always identify initiators only by
	  names and ignore ISID part in TransportIDs. This is useful for
	  Persistent Reservations with initiators which don't use ISID
	  in a standards confirming way, for instance by always
	  incrementing it on each reconnect, as well as to debug
	  Persistent Reservations.

	  If unsure, say "N".
