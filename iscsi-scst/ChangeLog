Summary of changes in iSCSI-SCST since it was IET
-------------------------------------------------

 - Commands processing flow changed to work with SCST. Significant
   cleanup was done. Modules and config files were renamed to allow to
   run with IET on the same host.

 - In IET the iSCSI negotiation isn't fully iSCSI RFC confirmed: it doesn't
   support ranges of values and, more important, violates RFC in case
   when in the IET config file some value for some parameter is set and
   a remote initiator doesn't initiate the negotiation for this
   parameter or declare its value. According to RFC, in this case IET
   shall use the RFC-specified default value, but it uses config file
   specified one instead. Looks like the implementation confuses IET
   config file default values and iSCSI RFC ones. The default values
   handling was fixed. But support for ranges remains unfixed (see ToDo
   file).

 - All shutdown/restart problems (resource leaks, hangups, etc.), especially
   under load, were fixed.

 - Full duplex network IO implemented.

 - Threading model reimplemented.

 - Digests calculation made multi-threaded.

 - TX data digest errors handling iSCSI RFC violation was fixed. Another one
   (SNACK handling) remains unfixed.

 - Ability to send data with sense in a single response added.

 - Ability to handle initiators misbehavior a bit improved: several BUG()'s
   were relaced by the proper handling. Hovewer, there is a plenty of work in
   this area left, IET is known to have a lot of weaknesses here.

 - A lot of other bugfixes and code cleanups.
