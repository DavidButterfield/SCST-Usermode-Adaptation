Introduction
-------------
iSCSI Enterprise Target is for building an iSCSI storage system on
Linux. It is aimed at developing an iSCSI target satisfying enterprise
requirements.

We borrow code from an Ardis iSCSI target (with respect to the GPL).


Installation
-------------
The iSCSI target requires a host running the Linux operating system
with a kernel version of 2.6.19 (2.6.14 - 2.6.18 kernels using
backward compatibility patches, see below) or newer. You need to
enable "Cryptographic API" under "Cryptographic options" in the kernel
config.  You also need to enable "CRC32c CRC algorithm" if you use
header or data digests. They are the kernel options, CONFIG_CRYPTO and
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CRC32C, respectively. The user-space code requires
OpenSSL library (http://www.openssl.org/).

The iSCSI target consists of kernel modules and a daemon. Since IET
is generally targetted at the latest stable mainline kernel, you might
need to apply a backward compatibility patch to compile it against
older kernel versions:

	patch -p0 < patches/compat-2.6.14-2.6.18.patch

Compilation of the kernel modules require the path to the kernel
sources:

	make KSRC=<kernel-src>

The path can also be set by editing the main Makefile. If KSRC is
omitted, make program will try to locate the kernel sources for
current running kernel.  Be sure to check whether it finds the right
kernel sources.

This will build the modules, the daemon, and the control tool. To
install both, use:

	make KSRC=<kernel-src> install

The kernel modules will be install in the module directory of the
kernel. The daemon and the control tool will be installed as ietd and
ietadm under /usr/sbin. The boot script will be installed as
iscsi-targt under /etc/init.d.

If you use Linux distribution that does not have /etc/init.d, the
boot script will not be installed. So you need to install it to an
appropriate directory manually.


Configuration
-------------
The daemon is configured via the configuration file /etc/ietd.conf.
See the man page and the example file for the current syntax.

The ietadm utility is for managing IET software dynamically. You can
change the configurations of running targets. See the help message.

The access control based on initiator address and target name patterns
is configured via two configuration files (/etc/initiators.allow and
/etc/initiators.deny). These files work like tcpd files
(/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny). This feature enables you to
hide a particular targets from some initiators. See the example files
for the supported expressions. You can change the configuration
dynamically. The modifications to the files become effective
immediately.


Starting
-------------
The target is not started automatically. So execute:

	/etc/init.d/iscsi-target start

Note that you must edit the configuration file before starting the
target.


Stopping
-------------
Execute:

	/etc/init.d/iscsi-target stop

Developer Notes
----------------
The central resource for IET development is the
<iscsitarget-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> mailing list.

Our subversion repository can be found at: svn://svn.berlios.de/iscsitarget

When submitting patches, please diff against the code in our repository's
trunk and adhere otherwise to the same rules that apply to Linux kernel
development, in particular the Linux kernel coding style
($KSRC/Documentation/CodingStyle) and the rules for submitting patches
($KSRC/Documentation/SubmittingPatches), i.e. please send patches inline as
plain text.
