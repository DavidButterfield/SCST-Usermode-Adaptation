 - Remove the "poor man solution" suspending. Instead, immediate/unsolicited
   data for suspended commands should be received in the dummy_page and
   then, when they are resumed, aborted with BUSY status. All other
   commands should proceed normally.

 - Separate iSCSI request and response structures. Currently they share the
   same structure. This architecture decision derived from IET and makes
   the code a lot less readable, maintainable and effective as well as more
   errors prone, so it must be corrected.
 
 - Code beautifying, i.e. make it be written in the same nice looking style.
   Particularly, all functions and variables names should share the same style.

 - __cmnd_abort() should be called by SCST core through new callback
   instead of the driver itself.

 - Fix support of ranges in parameters negotiation. Are there any initiators who
   use ranges and, hence, can be used for testing?

 - Minor "ToDo"'s spread in the code.
