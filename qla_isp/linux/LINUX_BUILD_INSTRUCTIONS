This driver is for Linux-2.4 and Linux-2.6 kernels only. If you build
in this directory, this is for Linux-2.4 only. To build Linux-2.6, change
directory to ../Linux-2.6.

Since this is a mature product, it's recommended that you just use the 2.4.32
kernel from the ftp.kernel.org repository and build this as a module.

If you need to build this inside the kernel tree itself, there is
a patch set for linux 2.4.20. This hasn't been tested in quite a while.
