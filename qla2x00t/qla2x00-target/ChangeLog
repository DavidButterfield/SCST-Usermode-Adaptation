Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.8 and 0.9.5
-----------------------------------------------------

 - Ported to 2.6.17.x and 2.6.18.
 
 - Updated for the latest SCST interfaces changes.

 - Cleanups and minor bug fixes.


Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.8 and 0.9.3.9
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x+, including 2.6.16-prex)

 - Fixed problem when "out-of-order frames rassembly" bit was wrongly set,
   which lead to only 1Gbps speed of 23xx cards.

 - Removed all code that deals with "use_sg == 0" data, since staring
   from SCST 0.9.5 commands data are always in SG-vector. 

 - Fixed hungup on the module unload.

 - Minor cleanups and fixes

Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.7 and 0.9.3.8
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x+, including 2.6.16-prex)

 - Minor cleanups

Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.6 and 0.9.3.7
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x+, including 2.6.16-prex)

 - Fix null pointer dereference in do_ctio_complete (thanks to Calvin Morrow)

Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.5 and 0.9.3.6
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x+, including 2.6.16-prex)

 - Include MEMSET, MEMCPY definitions
	
 - Patched to compile on 64bit cleanly (thanks to Ming Zhang <mingz@ele.uri.edu>
for patch)

- Fixed possible race during initial enabling of Target Mode (thanks to 
Mark Buechler <mark.buechler@gmail.com> for finding)
	
Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.4 and 0.9.3.5
-------------------------------------------------------
Patch vs: qla2xxx v8.01.03-k (in kernels 2.6.15.x)
	
 - Reset chip when switching from initiator to initator/target and back
implemented
	
 - Use 2K loop_id's for 23xx chips and thus change how sessions are
tracked.

 - Added Module Info

 - Fixed module counting with initiator module preventing it from going
away w/out telling us (pointed out by Vladislav Bolkhovitin
<vst@vlnb.net>)

 - Some minor debugging changes

Summary of changes between versions 0.9.3.2 of old driver and 0.9.3.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Support for the latest in-tree Qlogic initiator added by Nathaniel
Clark <nate@misrule.us>

 - Only one module is build and it interacts with a patched kernel
qla2xxx driver. The single module is called qla2x00tgt.ko instead of
having one for each driver type.

 - Target mode can be enabled via a sysfs interface on a per card basis.
Under the appropriate scsi_host there is now an entry
target_mode_enabled, which can read and written.

NOTES:

The initiator's req_pkt function has never updated the request queue pointers.
So the implementation for continuation packets, has never worked correctly.
