libfc: point-to-point: send FLOGI LS_ACC to assigned D_DID

The method we've been using for point-to-point mode requires
that the LS_ACC for the FLOGI uses the D_ID and S_ID assigned
to the remote port and local port, not those in the exchange.

This is not the correct method, but for now, it's what works
with the old target, as well as with new targets based on libfc.

This patch changes the addresses used accordingly.
