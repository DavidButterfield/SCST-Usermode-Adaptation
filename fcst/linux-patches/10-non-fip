libfcoe: fix debug message entering non-FIP mode

The debug message that indicated we are using non-FIP mode was
being printed only if we were already in non-FIP mode.
Also changed the message text to make it more clear the mode
is being set, not that the message is indicating how FLOGI
was received.
