# Warnfile:  included from a Makefile to set WFLAGS_WARN for inclusion near the ends of gcc command lines

# NOTES:
#   "-Wno-*" options negate noisy subsets of the first "-W" option seen on the same line.
#   counts mentioned below are of "distinct" warnings -- multiple warnings at the same file/line count as one

### SCST compiles clean (without warning messages) with these warnings enabled.
#	"-Wformat" warnings are entirely due to conflation of "long" and "long long" in format specifiers.
