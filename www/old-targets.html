<h1><small>Old target driver for QLogic 2200/2300 cards for 2.4 kernels<br>
</small></h1>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Old target driver for QLogic
2200/2300
cards is capable to work on 2.4 kernels. It has all required features
and
looks to be quite stable. It is designed to work in conjunction with
the initiator
driver, which is intended to perform all the initialization and
shutdown tasks. In the current release as a base for the initiator
driver was taken Red Hat's driver from the stock 2.4.20 kernel. Then it
was patched to enable the target mode and provide all
necessary callbacks, and it's still able to work as initiator only.
Mode, when a host acts as the initiator and the target simultaneously,
is also supported. This driver is obsoleted in favor of
2.6-based driver.<br>
<br>
The latest version is 0.9.3.4. Requires Linux kernel versions 2.4.20 or
higher and SCST version 0.9.3-pre4 or higher. If you are lucky, it
works also on 2.6 kernels, see README file
for details. Tested on i386 only, but
should work on any other supported by Linux platform.<br>
<br>
Currently it is not supported and listed here for historical reasons
only.<br>

<h1><small>Target drivers for Adaptec 7xxx and QLogic QLA12xx
cards</small></h1>
Target drivers for Adaptec 7xxx and QLogic QLA12xx cards have
been developed by Hu Gang and they available for download from <a
 href="http://bj.soulinfo.com/%7Ehugang/scst/tgt/">http://bj.soulinfo.com/~hugang/scst/tgt/</a>.
These drivers are not completed, but looks to be a good starting point
if you are going to use one of these cards.
SCST team don't have the appropriate hardware, therefore have not
tested and don't support these drivers. Send all questions to Hu Gang
&lt;hugang
% soulinfo.com&gt;. If some of these drivers don't compile for you, try
again with SCST version 0.9.3-pre2.<br>

<h1><small>Patches for UNH-iSCSI Target 1.5.03 and 1.6.00 to work over
SCST</small></h1>
SCST is much more advanced, than the internal mid-level of <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unh-iscsi">UNH-iSCSI target
driver</a>.
With SCST the iSCSI target benefits from all its features and gets
ability to use all its advantages, like high performance and
scalability, SMP support, required SCSI functionality emulation, etc.<br>
<br>
Since the interface between SCST and the target drivers is based on
work, done by UNH IOL, it was relatively simple to update UNH-iSCSI
target to work over SCST. Mostly it was "search and replace" job. The
built-in scsi_target remains available as a compile-time option.<br>
<br>
Requires Linux kernel versions 2.4.20 or
higher or 2.6.7 or higher and SCST version 0.9.2 or higher.<br>
<br>
Currently it is not supported and listed here for historical reasons
only.<br>
