				<h1>Old target driver for QLogic 22xx/23xx cards for 2.4 kernels</h1>
				<p><img src="images/t_unsupported.gif" width="100" height="120" class="float-left" />
				Old target driver for QLogic 22xx/23xx cards is capable to work on 2.4 kernels. 
				It has all required features and looks to be quite stable. It is designed to work in conjunction with the 
				initiator driver, which is intended to perform all the initialization and shutdown tasks. In the current release as 
				a base for the initiator driver was taken Red Hat's driver from the stock 2.4.20 kernel. Then it was patched to 
				enable the target mode and provide all necessary callbacks, and it's still able to work as initiator only. Mode, 
				when a host acts as the initiator and the target simultaneously, is also supported. This driver is obsoleted in 
				favor of 2.6-based driver.</p>
				<p>The latest version is 0.9.3.4. Requires Linux kernel versions 2.4.20 or higher and SCST version 0.9.3-pre4 or 
				higher. If you are lucky, it works also on 2.6 kernels, see README file for details. Tested on i386 only, but 
				should work on any other supported by Linux platform.</p>
				<p>Currently it is <strong>not supported</strong> and listed here for historical reasons only.</p>
				
				<h1>Target drivers for Adaptec 7xxx and QLogic QLA12xx cards</h1>
				<p><img src="images/t_unsupported.gif" width="100" height="120" class="float-left" />
				Target drivers for Adaptec 7xxx and QLogic QLA12xx cards have been developed by Hu Gang and they available for 
				download from <a href="http://bj.soulinfo.com/~hugang/scst/tgt/">http://bj.soulinfo.com/~hugang/scst/tgt/</a>. 
				These drivers are not completed, but looks to be a good starting point if you are going to use one of these cards. 
				SCST team don't have the appropriate hardware, therefore have not tested and don't support these drivers. 
				Send all questions to <strong>Hu Gang <hugang@soulinfo.com></strong>. If some of these drivers don't compile for 
				you, try again with SCST version 0.9.3-pre2.</p><br><br>
				
				<h1>Patches for UNH-iSCSI Target 1.5.03 and 1.6.00 to SCST</h1>
				<p><img src="images/t_unsupported.gif" width="100" height="120" class="float-left" />
				SCST is much more advanced, than the internal mid-level of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unh-iscsi">
				UNH-iSCSI target driver</a>. With SCST the iSCSI target benefits from all its features and gets ability to use all 
				its advantages, like high performance and scalability, SMP support, required SCSI functionality emulation, etc.</p>

				<p>Since the interface between SCST and the target drivers is based on work, done by UNH IOL, it was relatively 
				simple to update UNH-iSCSI target to work over SCST. Mostly it was "search and replace" job. The built-in 
				scsi_target remains available as a compile-time option.</p>

				<p>Requires Linux kernel versions 2.4.20 or higher or 2.6.7 or higher and SCST version 0.9.2 or higher.</p>
				<p>Currently it is <strong>not supported</strong> and listed here for historical reasons only.</p>
