<a href="http://stgt.berlios.de/">STGT</a> is alternative, independent
from SCST implementation of SCSI target framework for Linux. It has
different architecture, where SCSI target state machine is placed in
the user space, while in SCST all the processing done in the kernel.
Such architecture was acknowledged as a "right" one by the Linux SCSI
subsystem maintainers, so kernel's part of STGT quickly found its way
to the kernel. But such architecture has two inherent problems, namely
performance and complexity. See this thread: <a

Also you shouldn't be deceived by the fact
that some (small) part of STGT was accepted in the kernel. It doesn't
mean that STGT has the "kernel quality". In fact, STGT as a whole
similarly to any other out-of-tree project lives on its own, hence has
its own quality level, which isn't necessary better, than the quality
level of SCST. Actually, from such important aspect of quality as
simplicity, it might be quite contrary: e.g. SCST isn't required to
support HIGHMEM (nowadays it isn't necessary, but required for all
in-kernel components), which allowed to simplify memory management a
lot.<br>
