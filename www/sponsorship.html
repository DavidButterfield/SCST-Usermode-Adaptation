				<h1>Sponsoring of SCST integration into Linux kernel</h1>

				<p>At the moment, Linux doesn't have a SCSI target subsystem, which is 
				sufficiently good to satisfy the real life requirements, and there is a 
				growing demand in a such subsystem. At the same time, SCST has reached 
				<strong>mature and stable </strong> state and <strong>capable to satisfy
				</strong> all the requirements. 
				Also is has <strong>the widest choice</strong> of supported SCSI transports
				(iSCSI, Fibre Channel, Infiniband SRP, parallel SCSI, SAS), <strong>the
				best performance</strong> and <strong>the biggest features set</strong>.
				
				<p>So, the next logical step should be to <strong>include SCST in the
				mainline kernel</strong>.
				There is a lot of work to do before it can be achieved in areas of code
				preparation, submission, going through review circles, etc.
				Activities in this direction have been carrying out, but far slower than 
				necessary, because they are mostly done in a spare time.
				
				<p>Thus, you can speed up a <strong>LOT</strong> all the works related to
				SCST inclusion in the mainline kernel by <strong>sponsoring</strong> it.
				Ultimately, you can make them a full time work.
				
				<p>Investing in SCST integration in Linux kernel, you investing not only
				in making Linux <strong>the best storage OS</strong>, but, if your company
				has a product, based on SCST, you also investing in <strong>the secured
				future</strong>	of your product	and, hence, your company.
