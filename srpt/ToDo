1. Update the OFED wiki entries about SRP and SRPT:
   * https://wiki.openfabrics.org/tiki-index.php?page=SRP
   * https://wiki.openfabrics.org/tiki-index.php?page=SRPT+Installation


2. The initiator names supplied to the SCST core contain the target port name,
   which is wrong. Nobody identifies a man by the door through which he entered.
   Instead, a man has a name by which he is identified through his whole life.


3. Analyze and document the implications of
   sdev->mr = ib_get_dma_mr(sdev->pd, IB_ACCESS_LOCAL_WRITE).
