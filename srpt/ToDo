1. Update the OFED wiki entries about SRP and SRPT:
   * https://wiki.openfabrics.org/tiki-index.php?page=SRP
   * https://wiki.openfabrics.org/tiki-index.php?page=SRPT+Installation


2. The SRPT driver directly uses the internal state of the SCST core target
   state machine (scmnd->state), which is bad, bad, bad and generally not
   acceptable. Only dev handler are allowed to use them. This should be fixed.


3. Fix the race condition between srpt_refresh_port_work() and 
   srpt_remove_one(). Although the probability that this happens is very low,
   at least in theory it is possible that srpt_refresh_port_work() gets
   called for a port after srpt_remove_one() called kfree() on the data
   structure that contains the work_struct passed to srpt_refresh_port_work().
   It's not clear to me whether or not letting srpt_remove_one() wait until
   srpt_refresh_work() finished can result in a deadlock.


4. Find out from which threads the srpt_devices list can be accessed and
   whether it has to be protected by a spinlock or mutex.


5. Fix the issue that 'rmmod ib_srpt' under load hangs.


6. The initiator names supplied to the SCST core contain the target port name,
   which is wrong. Nobody identifies a man by the door through which he entered.
   Instead, a man has a name by which he is identified through his whole life.


7. Analyze and document the implications of
   sdev->mr = ib_get_dma_mr(sdev->pd, IB_ACCESS_LOCAL_WRITE).


8. Enable and test the LUN_RESET task management function.
