===================================

Version X.X.X, XX XXX 200X
--------------------------

This driver was originally developed by Hu Gang and then is developed by
Erik Habbinga <erikhabbinga@inphase-tech.com>. It is on the early stage
of development.

The current maintainer of this driver is Erik. Please send him all
question related to it (CC: scst-devel@lists.sourceforge.net).

This driver tested only on Linux kernel versions 2.6.15.x.

Building from the Linux kernel tree
-----------------------------------

To build from the kernel tree, you should:

1. Link drivers/message/fusion/mpt_scst to $(SCST_DIR)/mpt

2. Patch drivers/message/fusion/Makefile and
drivers/message/fusion/Kconfig by diffs from $(SCST_DIR)/mpt/in-tree

3. Correct in drivers/message/fusion/Makefile SCST_INC_DIR variable so
it points to correct directory with SCST include files.
