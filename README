Overview
========

This is the SCST development repository. It contains not a single
project SCST as one can think, but a number of them, which are divided
as the following:

1. SCST core in scst/ subdirectory

2. Administration utility for SCST core scstadmin in scstadmin/

3. Target drivers in own subdirectories qla2x00t/, iscsi-scst/, etc.

4. User space programs in usr/ subdirectory, like fileio_tgt.

5. Some various docs in doc/ subdirectory.

Those subprojects are in most cases independent from each other,
although some of them depend from the SCST core. They put in the single
repository only to simplify their development, they are released
independently.

Thus, use "make all" only if you really need to build everything.
Otherwise build only what you need, like for iSCSI-SCST:

make scst scst_install iscsi iscsi_install

For more information about each subproject see their README files.


QLogic target driver
====================

QLogic target driver in qla2x00t/ is the old one, forked from qla2xxx
from kernel 2.6.26. It is not maintained anymore and not built by
default by the common Makefile targets, like "all".

You can find the latest version of this driver in git://git.qlogic.com/scst-qla2xxx.git.
It is now maintained by QLogic, hence located in the QLogic's git.

To integrate it into the SCST build tree you need:

1. Clone the QLogic git tree somewhere in your system.

2. Create in the SCST root, i.e. this directory, a subdirectory with name
qla2x00t_git

3. Symlink drivers/scsi/qla2xxx subdirectory in the cloned git tree to the
qla2x00t_git subdirectory

Thats all. Now "make all" and other common and QLA specific root
Makefile targets "magically" start working. The bind mount is necessary
for the driver to correctly find the SCST header files. Symlinks can't
do it.

You can still build the old driver using qla_old* root Makefile targets.
